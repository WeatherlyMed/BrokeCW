low-pass filter (LPF) allows low-frequency signals to pass through while cuting out higher-frequency signals. 

How Low-Pass Filters Work
Basic Principle:

Pass Band: Frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency are allowed to pass through the filter.
Stop Band: Frequencies above the cutoff frequency are attenuated or blocked.
Components:

Resistor (R): Provides impedance to the circuit.
Capacitor (C): Blocks low-frequency signals but allows high-frequency signals to pass through.
Inductor (L): Blocks high-frequency signals while allowing low-frequency signals to pass.
Cutoff Frequency:

The cutoff frequency (f_c) is the point where the filter starts to attenuate the signal. It is defined by the following equations:
For RC filters: f_c = 1 / (2 * π * R * C)
For RL filters: f_c = R / (2 * π * L)
Types of Low-Pass Filters
RC Low-Pass Filter:

Components: Resistor and Capacitor.
Function: Attenuates high frequencies based on the RC time constant.
Equation: Cutoff frequency f_c = 1 / (2 * π * R * C)
Applications: Used in audio systems, signal conditioning.
RL Low-Pass Filter:

Components: Resistor and Inductor.
Function: Attenuates high frequencies based on the RL time constant.
Equation: Cutoff frequency f_c = R / (2 * π * L)
Applications: Used in power supplies and audio systems.
LC Low-Pass Filter:

Components: Inductor and Capacitor.
Function: Offers steeper attenuation than RC or RL filters due to its resonant properties.
Equation: Cutoff frequency f_c = 1 / (2 * π * sqrt(L * C))
Applications: Used in radio frequency circuits and signal processing.
Active Low-Pass Filter:

Components: Includes operational amplifiers along with resistors and capacitors.
Function: Provides gain and can be designed with various filter orders.
Applications: Used in more complex signal processing applications requiring high performance.
