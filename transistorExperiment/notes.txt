All avalible transistors use higher voltage than avalible from arduino keyer and this means even a mosfet is not feasible.
However, reversing the code for the keyer so that low is hit on up tones and high on down tones should help with this.
This also means the ground must be universal so that arduino ground(low) is also the 12v Low signal.

Notes:
All designs analysised used a single key to signal using a iambic (double) paddle means ajustments will need to me made.
