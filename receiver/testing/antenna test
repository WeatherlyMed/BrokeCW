8 inch scrap antenna quickly fails
All tests done with 2m dipole collapible ant
Will test with 20m arial dipole when weather improves

10 nF with 33uH = 6hz
45 nFwith 33uH = 11.5kHz
45 nF with one turn of jumper wire insulated = 11.3 kHz
45 nF with 5 turns pen size bare 14.8kHz
45 nF with 3 turns pen size bare 14.6kHz
screw driver turns bare wire
45 nF 11 turns 11.3khz
45 nF 5 turns 12.5 khz
45 nF 9 turns 12.1 khz
45 nF 4 turns 11.7khz
22 nF 11 turns 10.2 khz
22 nF 9 turns 10 khz
22 nF 4 turns 10.4khz
22 nF 2 turns 10.8khz

at 1khz audbible with double and single high pass
at 2khz aubible with double and single high pass
at 7khz a single high pass is barrely aubible
at 7khz a double high pass produces silence
a single pass at 14kHz is barrely audible
added a potentometer
Theashold around 45khz with single pass


Created double pass varible resistor increased magnification and added an external antenna connector
